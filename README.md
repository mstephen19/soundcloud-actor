## About SoundCloud Scraper

Scrape information on tracks, users, and comments with this free SoundCloud scraper. Input multiple usernames, queries, or URLs and scrape them all simultaneously.

SoundCloud is an online audio streaming service ideal for connecting emerging artists with an audience in pursuit of discovering new music. Therefore, its user base can be split into creators, listeners, and curators, who connect the two by creating playlists. The ability to comment on tracks adds a layer of interaction to the platform, and SoundCloud can therefore be viewed as [a form of social media](https://plus.inflyteapp.com/soundcloud-say-were-a-form-of-social-media/).

SoundCloud has closed its Google Form for granting developers access to its API, making gathering data from the website all the more complicated. This actor aims to fill this gap in the market by offering a quick and easy solution to scrape user info, tracks, and comments.

  ]
```

### Output for a keyword query

Keyword queries work a bit differently. By scraping by keyword, the scraper gives back the raw data SoundCloud uses from their own API. This means that every object includes a plethora of information about the result it represents.
